# Multi-Touch Attribution Models in Python

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of various multi-touch attribution models to analyze marketing channel performance. These models help in attributing conversions to different touchpoints (marketing channels) along the customer journey.

## Attribution Models Implemented

- **First-Touch Attribution**: Assigns full credit to the first interaction a user has before converting.
- **Last-Touch Attribution**: Assigns full credit to the last interaction a user has before converting.
- **Linear Attribution**: Distributes the credit evenly across all touchpoints leading to a conversion.
- **U-Shaped Attribution**: 40% credit is assigned to the first and last interactions, while the remaining 20% is split equally across the middle interactions.
